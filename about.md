Welcome! RDojo is the University of Southern California Psychology department's R group. We --  primarily graduate students and faculty -- hold bi-weekly meetings that consist of small workshops focused generally on using RStudio for scientific computing. We are a multi-purpose group that shares the belief that the best way to learn something (i.e. R) is to teach it. Accordingly, our workshops range from new user's first forays into data manipulation through advanced statistical modeling.

Some of our general topics are: 

* Frequentist and Bayesian statistics
* Machine learning
* Simulation
* Reproducibility
* and Data visualization

Each workshop is accompanied by an R notebook and every notebook that we produce will be posted to our blog.

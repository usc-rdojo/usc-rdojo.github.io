RDojo Presentations
-------------------

RDojo aims to be interactive, educational, and useful. To help achieve
this, we ask that all RDojo presentations be accompanied by a
fully-functional R Markdown file, all requisite data, and a PDF
generated from that file. This ensures several things:

1.  *Functionality.* To render a PDF from an R Markdown file, the code
    must be completely self-contained. If your code doesn't work, you
    cannot render a PDF. This helps make sure that your code *does*
    work, as well as increases the usability of your code for others.

2.  *Documentation*. Ever RDojo presentation will be posted to the RDojo
    blog. For this to happen, presentations need to be blog-ready. If
    all presentations are submitted in R Markdown format, then it is
    easy to convert them into a blog post. This helps ensure that
    attendees have easy access to functional code *and* that RDojo
    presentations are preserved for future use.

Working with R Markdown
-----------------------

While there are different frameworks for creating R Markdown, I think
that R Notebooks are the most useful. Like all R Markdown files, they
can easily be used to generate a markdown file for our blog, but, as you
will soon see, they render output beneath code chunks. This feature is
particularly useful for live presentations.

### Creating an R Notebook

To create a new R Notebook, select *file* -&gt; *New File* -&gt; *New R
Notebook*

![Creating a new R Notebook](./external_images/create-r-notebook.png)

This will open a new R script that looks like this:

![Creating a new R Notebook](./external_images/r-notebook-example.png)

There are three important components shown in the default script
generated when you create a new R Notebook: a header, a code chunk, and
markdown text.

1.  **Header.** The header is the code at the top of the file preceded
    and followed by `---`. This provides meta- and formatting
    information that will be used when you render a document from your
    markdown.

2.  **Code chunk.** A code chunk is the code preceded and followed by
    \`\`\`. *Code chunks are where you put R code*. For example, the
    code `plot(cars)` is contained by the pictured code chunk.

3.  **Markdown.** Markdown is a simple language for generating HTML. It
    combines raw text with various formatting tags to generate
    documents. In addition to running R code, R Markdown and R Notebooks
    rely on markdown to generate text. There are many resources for
    learning markdown and you don't need to be an expert in order to
    make nice R Notebooks. Here is a good resource for getting started:
    <https://beegit.com/markdown-cheat-sheet>. The linked content
    explains how to create bold and italicized text, lists, links,
    images, tables, etc.

These three components are all that is necessary for creating an R
Notebook. As your learning, it can be helpful to look at the R Notebook
file used for generating a markdown document. For example, from the code
for this file, you could learn basic formatting commands and how to
automatically create a table of contents.

### Working with code chunks

Code chunks themselves have two important components:

1.  **Paramaters.** You place these inside the `{r}` tag. Three
    important paramaters are:

<!-- -->

1.  *name.* You really should name your code chunks because it helps
    users keep track of which chunks do what. To name your code chunk,
    just include the desired name after `r` in the tag: `{r name_here}`
2.  *eval.* Should the code be evaluated (i.e. run) when the document is
    generated? The default is `TRUE`, meaning that code in code chunks
    will be executed by default. You can change this by setting
    `eval=FALSE` (i.e. `{r no_run, eval=FALSE}`).
3.  *echo.* Should the code chunk itself be printed (i.e. included) in
    the rendered document. Sometimes, you need to run code that needn't
    be included in the rendered document. You can exclude code chunks by
    setting `echo=FALSE`. The default is `TRUE`.

A quick guide to code chunk paramaters (and R Markdown in general) is
available
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

1.  **Code.** Obviously, code chunks are for including code, whether you
    want to run it or not. You can put any R code in a code chunk and it
    will be handled by the rendering processing according to that
    chunk's paramater specifications.

When you are working interactively with an R Notebook, you still need to
put your code in code chunks.

To create a new code chunk you can select *Code* -&gt; *Insert Code
Chunk* from the menu or you can use keyboard shortcuts: \* Mac =
Ctrl+Alt+I \* Windows = Command+Option+I

Code chunks also have several other nice features. For example, the
green play button show in the above image will cause an entire code
chunk to run. Also, when you are running code interactively, the output
of the code will be displayed below that code's code chunk.

Here is an example of code and output generated by a code chunk:

    summary(cars)

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

    plot(cars)

![](~/offline_research/git_repos/usc-rdojo.github.io/images/R/2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

As you can see, two commands were run `summary(cars)`, which generated a
summary table of the R dataset `cars` and `plot(cars)` which generated a
plot of `cars`.

Rendering documents from R Notebooks
------------------------------------

To render a document from an R Notebook, click the `Knit` button in the
toolbar. If you open the drop-down menu for that button, you will see
that you can select a format for the document. To Knit a PDF, simply
click 'Knit to PDF'.

RDojo guidelines
----------------

In addition to submitting R Notebooks and a rendered PDF for a RDojo
submission, we ask presenters to follow several other guidelines:

1.  **Include a table of contents to simplify navigating the document.**
    To automatically generate a table of contents, you can copy the
    format of the header for this document:

![Header with TOC](./external_images/header-with-toc.png)

1.  **Use a 'year-month-date-title' name for your R Notebook file**
    Using a common file name with a date helps keep everything
    organized.

2.  **Create a directory/folder for your presentation.** The name of
    this directory should be the same as the name of your R Notebook.
    This directory (and its contents) will be included in the RDojo
    github repository.

3.  **Put requisite data in a 'data' sub-directory.** If your notebook
    relies on data that is not available in an R package, please create
    a sub-directory called 'data' in your presentation folder and place
    the data there.

4.  **Include external images in an 'external\_images' sub-directory**
    If you want to include screen captures or any other images *not*
    generated by your notebook, please include them in a sub-directory
    called 'external\_images.'

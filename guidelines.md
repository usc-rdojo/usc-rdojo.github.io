Our goal is that RDojo attendees of all levels of R experience give presentations on a range of topics. Thus, we have aimed to make the presentation format as straight-forward as possible. However, we also want to prioritize reproducibility and streamline the blog-posting process. 

Toward all of these goals, we request that all RDojo presentations are written in R Markdown and submitted via the RDojo Github repository. For an introduction to R Markdown (with special attention to RDojo presentations), you can read [this post](https://usc-rdojo.github.io/creating-an-r-notebook/). For an introduction to using RStudio and Github, you can read this post. 

More specifically, we ask that all presenters follow these guidelines: 

**Presentation Formatting**

*Presentation submitted as fully-functional R Notebook.* R Notebooks allow you to integrate text, code, and output into a single document. Creating your presentation in an R Notebook allows us to easily convert it to a blog post *and* it ensure reproducibility both for attendees and future users. You can read more about them [here](https://usc-rdojo.github.io/creating-an-r-notebook/)


**Submission guidelines**

* Your presentation should be written as an R Notebook. R Notebooks allow you to integrate text, code, and output into a single document. Creating your presentation in an R Notebook allows us to easily convert it to a blog post *and* it ensure reproducibility both for attendees and future users. You can read more about them [here](https://usc-rdojo.github.io/creating-an-r-notebook/)


* Your R Notebook presentation file should be placed in a directory. The directory name **must** start with a yyyy-mm-dd formatted date and should include an informative phrase after the date. For example, '2018-01-05-anova-in-r'. 

* If your R Notebook requires external data files, place them in a subdirectory called /data/ within your presentation directory. 

* In addition to your R Notebook and data directory and files, please include an unformatted text file called 'yml_header.txt' containing the following text: 

\-\-\-  
layout: post  
title: [presentation title]  
author: [first_last]  
\-\-\-  
  
where '\-\-\-' is three consecutive dashes/minus signs, [presentation title] is replaced by your desired presentation title (without the brackets), and [first_last] is replaced by your first name followed by an underscore and then your last name. This file can be created in R Studio by selecting *File* -> *New Files* -> *Text File* from the RStudio menu. You can then copy and paste the above text and make the requisite changes. 

* Please send a zipped copy of your presentation directory (and contents) to [usc-rdojo@usc.edu](mailto:usc-rdojo@usc.edu). 

**If you would like to include external images in your presentation, please follow these additional guidelines**

* **Include external images in the directory images/R/[name of R Markdown file without '.Rmd']/** If you want to include screen captures or any other images *not* generated by your notebook, please replicate this folder structure and place your images in the lowest-level folder. For example, if your R Markdown file is called 2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook.Rmd, you would place external images in the following directory structure (starting at the level of the submission directory):

* 2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook 
    * images
        * R
            * 2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook
                * Images go at this level
                
                
7. **Provide *two* paths to the external images.** To ensure that your external images will be placed in the correct directory when the blog post is generated from your presentation *and* that your R Notebook is fully-functional, you need to provide two paths to the external images. One of these paths needs to start with a forward slash `/`. The other path must *not* start with a forward slash. 

For example, this post includes an image called 'r-notebook-example.png' which is located at the path 'images/R/2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook/r-notebook-example.png'. In .Rmd for this post, two paths to this image are included: 

`![](/images/R/2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook/r-notebook-example.png)`  
  
`![](images/R/2018-01-04-creating-an-r-notebook/r-notebook-example.png)`

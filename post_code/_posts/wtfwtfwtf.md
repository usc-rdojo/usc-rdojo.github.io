One of the primary goals of RDojo is providing value to R users with
different degrees of expertise. So, you **do not** need to be an expert
(or anything close) to participate in RDojo -- if you've never used R in
your life, that's fine!

However, because we want to be useful to many different levels of users,
we do ask that you come prepared with the kind of basic knowledge that
you can get with a little bit of exploration and elbow grease.

Here's a list of things that you might want to do/be familiar with:

-   *Install R and RStudio.* RStudio is a user-friendly program that
    streamlines working with the statistical computing platform R. Most
    R users (but certainly not all) use RStudio and that's what we will
    be doing at RDojo. To install RStudio, you first have to install R.
    There are ample guides for installing both programs for any given
    operating system, so if you run into trouble Google can probably
    help you out.

-   *Install Latex* One of the features of RStudio that RDojo will rely
    on will be the program's capacity for document generation. Using a
    package --an RStudio program-- called `knitr`, you can dynamically
    generate PDF's, html files, and word documents that incorporate
    formatted text, code, and computational and graphical output. Once
    you get comfortable with this framework, you can actually write
    entire manuscripts in RStudio and you'll never have to copy and
    paste a single number from a statistical test. To use `knitr` you
    need to install a formatting language called latex. You can do that
    here <a href='https://www.latex-project.org/get/'>. You can read
    more about knitr and generating formatted documents in RStudio here
    <a href ='https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr'>

*NOTE:* **Installing latex requires downloading a large file; you might
want to do this overnight.**

-   *Spend some time getting comfortable with R & RStudio* There are
    many good resources for learning R/RStudio. While learning about
    R/Rstudio is the entire purpose of RDojo, it's useful for everyone
    to have some degree of familiarity with the basics. You can find a
    list of excellent introductory resources here
